            SCS is proud to work with some amazing sponsors that make our events and all the work that we do possible. 
            If you are interested in sponsoring SCS, whether on a regular or event-specific basis, there are a number of 
            different ways this can benefit your company. From direct access to some of the most talented students at Concordia
