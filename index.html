              <h3>Help you learn new skills</h3>
              Through our tutorials, you’ll encounter tools and programming
              languages that you may never see in your classes, such as Git,
              Android and Python. These skills will help you tremendously when
              working on projects and looking for a job.

              <h3>Give you extra programming practice</h3>
              Aside from a few small assignments and projects, your classes
              won’t give you very much practical experience. During our weekly
              Algorithm Time event, you can challenge yourself with fun coding
              problems, some of which can potentially be given to you in a real
              job interview. You can also participate in awesome programming
              competitions like CS Games and IEEEXtreme, which are not only tons
              of fun but give you excellent coding practice.

              <h3>Help you in your job hunt</h3>
              Networking is extremely important when it comes to your future
              career. We host events like guest speakers and company tours,
              which will give you the opportunity to meet with representatives
              of different companies and build your network.
